# Quantum Error Correcting

A Python library for implementing and simulating quantum error correction codes. This project focuses on error correction algorithms like the Shor code and explores their applications in mitigating noise in quantum computing.
We improved Classiq HHL Algorithm by adding a simulation of pre-measurement noise addition, and compared the performance with/out 3-qubit-correction of different qubits (res/indicator/phase/all/none).

## Dependencies

This library is dependent on Python 3.6+. Please install Numpy and Squanch libraries before starting.

```
pip install numpy
pip install squanch
pip install classiq
```
